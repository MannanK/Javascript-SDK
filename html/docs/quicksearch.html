You can read more about the Feed Media API at http://feed.fm/. The primary object used to communicate with the Feed API is the Feed.Session class, which handles authentication and interfaces with the Feed REST endpoints. You probably won't use that, however. You'll use an instance of the Feed.Player class, which hides the complexity of requesting new songs from the server via Feed.Session, and just exports a simple API for starting/stopping music playback and getting updates on the status. The Feed.PlayerView is an example class that makes use fo the Feed.Player to visualize a simple HTML player. This javascript library requires a browser that can do CORS (Firefox 3.5+, Safari 4+, Chrome 3+, IE 10+). Before you begin, you should have an account at feed.fm where you've created a set of authentication credentials (token and secret) and set up at least one placement If you have not already done so, please go to http://feed.fm/. 1 Minute Guide to Creating a Player and Streaming Music0) Pull up this jsbin page so you don't have to type anything. 1) Include the 'dist/feed.js' source in your HTML - either directly from your website or from feed.fm: &lt;script type='application/javascript' src='http://feed.fm/js/latest/feed.js'&gt;&lt;/script&gt;If you've already got jQuery in your page, you can use 'js/latest/feed-without-jquery.js' and the player will use the global window.jQuery object. 2) Enter the minimal HTML to display the player: &lt;div id=&quot;player-view-div&quot;&gt; &lt;div class='status'&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;button class=&quot;play-button&quot;&gt;play&lt;/button&gt; &lt;button class=&quot;pause-button&quot;&gt;pause&lt;/button&gt; &lt;button class=&quot;skip-button&quot;&gt;skip&lt;/button&gt; &lt;/div&gt;3) Create an instance of the player and the player view: var player = new Feed.Player('your-token', 'your-secret', { secure: true }); var playerView = new Feed.PlayerView('player-view-div', player); player.tune(); // or player.play() to auto-play immediatelyThe user can now start/stop music via the simple player interface. Working with Feed.PlayerViewFeed.PlayerView should be given the ID of an element in the page and a reference to a Feed.Player instance, and it will update child elements based on player events and listen to user clicks to tell the Feed.Player to pause/play/skip. Child elements are identified by their class name and are used as described below: status - This is updated to display the song currently being played, or the name of the placement that we're streaming from. The 'formatPlay(play)' method can be overridden to change how the current song is formatted, and the 'formatPlacement(placement)' method can be overriden to change how the placement is formatted. Also, if there are errors or alerts that need to be displayed, those are placed here and an 'alert' class is added to this element. After displaying an alert, the status is automatically reverted back to the song or placement text after a few seconds. elapsed - As a song is playing, the text of this element is updated with the elapsed playback time in the format '0:00'. duration - When a song starts playing, the text of this element is set to the total duration of the song in the format '0:00'. progress - While a song is playing the 'width' of this element is changed from 0% to 100%. play-button - When clicked, this will start playback. This button may be disabled (for instance, when a song is already playing). The button is enabled by adding a 'button-enabled' class. The button is disabled by adding a 'button-disabled' class and setting the 'disabled' attribute to true. pause-button - When clicked, this will pause playback. This button may be disabled (for instance, when a song is already paused). The button is enabled by adding a 'button-enabled' class. The button is disabled by adding a 'button-disabled' class and setting the 'disabled' attribute to true. skip-button - When clicked, this will request a song skip. This button may be disabled (for instance, when a song may not be skipped). The button is enabled by adding a 'button-enabled' class. The button is disabled by adding a 'button-disabled' class and setting the 'disabled' attribute to true. The sample jsbin has a function to display in the javascript console all the events that the player emits. When creating your own player skin, most everything can be stylized without having to edit javascript. For most projects, you should be able to fully customize the player using only CSS rules that take into account the 'button-enabled' and 'button-disabled' classes, along with the state of the player that is attached as a class to the top level HTML element of the player. Working with Feed.PlayerThe Feed.Player class retrieves music from the Feed.fm servers and sends them to the browser for playback. The class requires a token and secret in order to create an instance of the player: var player = new Feed.Player('token', 'secret', { secure: true });The final argument is optional and lets you specify some extra parameters to for the player (fully documented here). The player should be started with a call to tune() or play(). tune() will cause the player to load up information about the current placement, and play() will cause the player to tune() and then immediately start playing music. Music can be paused with a call to pause(), or skipped with a call to skip(), or resumed/started with a call to play(). The player emits named events that you can attach to in order to follow the state of the player. To follow an event, use the on() method, and to stop following an event use the off() method. Event handling comes from the BackBone.js project. Some example usage: // simple callback player.on('play-completed', function() { console.log('a play completed!'); }); // third argument sets 'this' for callback function player.on('play-started', handler.someFunction, handler); // passing 'all' as the event will cause all events to be sent to this callback player.on('all', function(event) { console.log('received: ', event); }); // turn off all handlers for this event player.off('play-completed'); // turn off a specific handler for this event player.off('play-started', handler.someFunction);The player emits the following events: not-in-us - Feed.fm doesn't think the client is located in the US, and so it will refuse to serve up music. When this event is emitted, you can assume the player will no longer function. placement - This event provides information about the placement that music is being pulled from. This is called before any music starts, and also after a call to change the current placement via setPlacementId(). This includes information about the placement that was retrieved from the feed.fm servers. At this point, only the name and id of the placement are returned: player.on('placement', function(placement) { console.log('the placement id is ' + placement.id + ' and name ' + placement.name); }); stations - This event provides the list of stations associated with the placement we are pulling music from. It is triggered before any music starts, and also after a call to change the current placement via setPlacementId(). ```js player.on('stations', function(stations) { console.log('there are ' + stations.length + ' stations. The first is named ' + stations[0].name); }); play-started - This is sent when playback of a specific song has started. Details of the song that has just started are passed as an argument and look like the following: { &quot;id&quot;:&quot;132459570&quot;, &quot;station&quot;: { &quot;id&quot;:&quot;727&quot;, &quot;name&quot;:&quot;Pretty Lights Music&quot; }, &quot;audio_file&quot;: { &quot;id&quot;:&quot;8707&quot;, &quot;duration_in_seconds&quot;:349, &quot;track&quot;: { &quot;id&quot;:&quot;15226435&quot;, &quot;title&quot;:&quot;Starve the Ego, Feed the Soul&quot; }, &quot;release&quot;: { &quot;id&quot;:&quot;1550367&quot;, &quot;title&quot;:&quot;Drink the Sea&quot; }, &quot;artist&quot;: { &quot;id&quot;:&quot;1176632&quot;, &quot;name&quot;:&quot;The Glitch Mob&quot; }, &quot;codec&quot;:&quot;mp3&quot;, &quot;url&quot;:&quot;http://stor02.fuzzcdn.com/path/to/mp3&quot; } } play-paused - This is sent when playback of the current song is paused. play-resumed - This is sent when playback of the current song is resumed after pausing. play-completed - This is sent when playback of the current song is complete or is aborted (due to a skip, for instance). plays-exhausted - If there are no more songs that a user can listen to, this event is triggered. skip-denied - If a call was made to skip() to skip the current song, but the server denied it (due to skip restrctions), then this event will be emitted. In addition to responding to events, the current state of the player can be queried with getCurrentState(). That call will return one of the following strings: playing - the player is currently playing a song paused - the player is paused idle - the player has no song actively playing or paused Because mobile clients require audio playback to begin only during a user-initiated event, the player should only be initialized with tune() on a mobile device, and play() should be called in a click event handler. Go DeeperThe Feed.Player class is built on top of a Feed.Session class that manages authentication and low level communication with the feed server. In the normal state of events, you shouldn't need to work at this low of a level. If you do, feel free to contact eric@feed.fm for details. The Feed.Player class makes use of the exceptional SoundManager2 library. Details can be found in the speaker.js file, which encapsulates our usage of SM2. × Search results Close Documentation generated by JSDoc 3.4.0 on 2016-04-08T12:51:12-07:00 using the DocStrap template.

It holds a Session#currentPlay that represents the song that has started playback for the user, and the Session#nextPlay, which will be the next song to play when the currentPlay is completed. A call to Session#setCredentials kicks off a request to the Feed.fm servers to see if the client can play music. Either a Session#event:session-available or Session#event:session-not-available event will be triggered to indicate if the user is given a session to request music with. If Session#event:session-available is triggered, then the client can call Session#requestNextPlay to kick off retrieval of music for playback. The general usage of this class is: var session = new Feed.Session(); session.on('session-available', function() { // music is available for the user. // session.getStations() will return list of available stations. // use session.setStation() to pick station, if we don't want default session.requestNextPlay(); // start retrieving songs }); session.on('session-not-available', function() { // no music is available for the user for some reason }); session.on('next-play-available', function(nextPlay) { // if session.currentPlay is null, then try to start playback of // nextPlay and then call session.playStarted(); // if session.currentPlay is not null, then we could start // loading the audio data for nextPlay in anticipation of // playing this song next }); session.on('current-play-changed', function(currentPlay) { // when currentPlay is not null, this means we just started // playback of currentPlay // when currentPlay is null, it means we just completed playback // of a song. If nextPlay is not null, we should try to begin // playback of it and call session.rejectPlay() (if the song couldn't // be retrieved or started) or session.playStarted() followed by // session.requestSkip() or session.playCompleted(). // Iff nextPlay is null then we're still waiting for the next // song and can expect a next-play-available event soon. }); session.on('no-music-available', function() { // no more music is available for the current station. }); session.setCredentials('token', 'secret'); // kicks off request to server for sessionIt is best to think of this class as constantly trying to keep a song in the queue for playback. When you advance a song in it from next to current (by calling Session#playStarted), the class tries to get another song queued up for you automatically. new Session(options) Parameters: Name Type Description options object options for the session Properties Name Type Argument Default Description audioFormats string &lt;optional&gt; mp3 string with comma separated list of preferred media formats: mp3 or aac maxBitrate string &lt;optional&gt; 128 max bitrate (in kbps) of requested audio files Members &lt;readonly&gt; activeStation :object reference to the station we're pulling songs from Type: object &lt;readonly&gt; available :boolean when true, music is available; when false, no music is available; when null, we don't know if music is available yet Type: boolean &lt;readonly&gt; canSkip :boolean if false, the current song may not be skippedj Type: boolean &lt;readonly&gt; currentPlay :object song that is currently being played back to user Type: object &lt;readonly&gt; nextPlay :object song that is queued to be played next. This will become the Session#currentPlay when Session#playStarted is called. Type: object &lt;readonly&gt; stations :Array.&lt;object&gt; array of station objects that represent available stations we can tune to Type: Array.&lt;object&gt; Methods playCompleted() Inform the server that the current song has completed, set Session#currentPlay to null, and ensure that a request for the next song is in progress or has completed. playStarted() After playback of the Session#nextPlay has begun, call this method to promote the play to Session#currentPlay, null out the value of Session#nextPlay, tell the server we have started playback, and start requesting the next value for Session#nextPlay. rejectPlay() If we are unable to start playback of Session#nextPlay, then call this in place of Session#playStarted to report the song as being unplayable. This will kick off a request for a new Session#nextPlay value (and associated Session#event:next-play-available event). requestDislike() Mark the currently playing song as disliked. requestLike() Mark the currently playing songs as liked. requestNextPlay() Request a new play if we aren't already getting one or have one already. When a new play is retrieved, a Session#event:next-play-available event is triggered. Note that if a Session#nextPlay is already not null and this method is called, nothing will happen. requestSkip() Ask the server if we can skip the current song. Call the optional success or failure functions depending on the response. If the server allows the skip, then a virtual Session#playCompleted call is made you can expect a Session#event:current-play-did-change event that sets Session#currentPlay to null. If the server disallows the skip (despite Session#canSkip being true) a Session#event:skip-status-did-change event is triggered. requestUnlike() Mark the currently playing song as neither liked nor disliked. setCredentials(token, secret) Assign public and private tokens and kick off request to ask server for a session, leading ultimately to Session#event:session-available or Session#event:session-not-available being triggered. Parameters: Name Type Description token string token provided by feed.fm secret string secret provided by feed.fm setStation(station) Set the current station from which we pull music and trigger an Session#event:active-station-did-change event. This kills any background requests for new plays and throws away any existing Session#nextPlay value. You'll need to call Session#requestNextPlay to start pulling in new music after making this call or receiving the Session#event:active-station-did-change event. Parameters: Name Type Description station object a station (available from Session#stations) suspend() Save all the state variables for this instance into a simple object so that we might recreate the state in the future (or another window, for example). Returns: a simple object to be passed to Session#unsuspend at a later time. Type object unsuspend(state) Restore the state of this session from a previously suspended station. Parameters: Name Type Description state object value returned from Session#suspend updatePlay(elapsedTime) Inform the server that we have elapsed playback. This may be called multiple times during playback. Parameters: Name Type Description elapsedTime number total number of seconds of the current song that have played since the song started. Events active-station-did-change This indicates that the Session#activeStation values has changed. A call to Session#requestNextPlay should be made to kick off retrieval of music from this new station. current-play-did-change This indicates the Session#currentPlay value has changed. The new value may be null (indicating the most recently playing song completed) or non-null (indicating Session#playStarted has been called and what was previously the Session#nextPlay has now become the Session#currentPlay. next-play-available This indicates Session#nextPlay has a non-null value. no-more-music This indicates no more music is available in the current station and retrieval of music from Feed.fm has stopped. session-available This indicates a response was received from the Feed.fm servers and music is available for this client. This event is triggered after Session#setCredentials is called. Upon receipt of this event, Session#requestNextPlay should be called to kick of retrieving music from Feed.fm. session-not-available This indicates a response was received from the Feed.fm servers and they say this client may not retrieve music. This event is triggered after Session#setCredentials is called. skip-status-did-change This indicates the Session#canSkip value has changed unexpected-error This indicates an unexpecte error was received from the server, and so music retrieval has stopped. × Search results Close Documentation generated by JSDoc 3.4.0 on 2016-04-08T12:51:12-07:00 using the DocStrap template.
