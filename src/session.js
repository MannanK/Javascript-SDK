 /**
 * @classdesc 
 *
 * This class talks to the Feed.fm REST API to pull audio items for
 * playback. It holds a {@link Session#currentPlay} that represents
 * the song that has started playback for the user, and the 
 * {@link Session#nextPlay}, which will be the next song to play when
 * the currentPlay is completed.
 *
 * A call to {@link Session#setCredentials} kicks off a request to
 * the Feed.fm servers to see if the client can play music. Either
 * a {@link Session#event:session-available} or 
 * {@link Session#event:session-not-available} event will be triggered
 * to indicate if the user is given a session to request music with.
 *
 * If {@link Session#event:session-available} is triggered, then the
 * client can call {@link Session#requestNextPlay} to kick off retrieval
 * of music for playback.
 *
 * The general usage of this class is:
 *
 * ```
 * var session = new Feed.Session();
 *
 * session.on('session-available', function() {
 *   // music is available for the user.
 *   // session.getStations() will return list of available stations.
 *   // use session.setStation() to pick station, if we don't want default
 *   session.requestNextPlay();   // start retrieving songs
 * });
 *
 * session.on('session-not-available', function() {
 *   // no music is available for the user for some reason
 * });
 *
 * session.on('next-play-available', function(nextPlay) {
 *   // if session.currentPlay is null, then try to start playback of
 *   // nextPlay and then call session.playStarted();
 *
 *   // if session.currentPlay is not null, then we could start
 *   // loading the audio data for nextPlay in anticipation of
 *   // playing this song next
 * });
 *
 * session.on('current-play-did-change', function(currentPlay) {
 *   // when currentPlay is not null, this means we just started
 *   // playback of currentPlay
 *
 *   // when currentPlay is null, it means we just completed playback
 *   // of a song. If nextPlay is not null, we should try to begin
 *   // playback of it and call session.rejectPlay() (if the song couldn't
 *   // be retrieved or started) or session.playStarted() followed by
 *   // session.requestSkip() or session.playCompleted().
 *   // Iff nextPlay is null then we're still waiting for the next
 *   // song and can expect a next-play-available event soon.
 * });
 *
 * session.on('no-music-available', function() {
 *   // no more music is available for the current station.
 * });
 *
 * session.setCredentials('token', 'secret'); // kicks off request to server for session
 * ```
 *
 * It is best to think of this class as constantly trying to
 * keep a song in the queue for playback. When you advance a song
 * in it from next to current (by calling {@link Session#playStarted}), the class
 * tries to get another song queued up for you automatically.
