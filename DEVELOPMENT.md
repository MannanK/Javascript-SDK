# Develoment

All the source javascript is in src/*.js. We're using ES6 code
with modules, transpiled via Babel and Rollup, to create our
library. ESLint is used to keep things nice and clean along the
way.

## Process

Make sure you've run `npm install` to get all the node_modules
that we need. You'll also need to install Rollup
globally (`npm install -g rollup`).

Then run `npm run dev` to kick off a watch process and local web
server. As you edit source files, they'll be transpiled
automatically and you can reload/run things in the browser.

## Release

Haven't done this yet.
